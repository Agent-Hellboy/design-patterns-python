# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of different design patterns implemented in Python. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design, and they provide a way to solve common design problems effectively.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation at hand. The following creational design patterns are covered:

### Builder Pattern

#### Date: 6 Nov 2023 

The Builder pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. It provides a flexible and readable way to create complex objects step by step.

In the Builder pattern, a builder class is responsible for constructing the object. It provides methods to set the desired attributes or properties of the object. The client code uses the builder to construct the object and obtain the final result.

#### Why Ice Cream?

To explain the Builder pattern, the example of creating custom ice creams with various toppings is used. This example demonstrates how the Builder pattern allows the creation of complex objects (ice creams) step by step, by adding different toppings. The flexibility of choosing toppings and the ability to create custom ice cream combinations highlight the benefits of the Builder pattern.
